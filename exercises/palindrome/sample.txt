I didn't hear what Bob said to Madam Anna. All I know is that within a single day
their relationship had completely changed. I have an appointment with Bob this noon.
I don't know what to do. I should have listened to my mom and my dad. Hannah too.

Bob and I were standing by the racecar track.
  "I'm gonna level with you Otto", said Bob. "Things were not good between us. Our
relationship was like a kayak, or a kelek (a type of raft used in the Middle East),
in a stream of redder and redder anger. I had to get out.. Get out like a Civic
Honda escaping police radar."

I didn't say a word. All I could think about was the alala, a type of Hawaiian crow,
that I had heard once. I disappeared like the toot of a racecar. I needed my Xanax
and some nice ABBA songs to relax to. So I did just that.
